<h2>Game Description</h2>
<p>
The I.T. Wordle game is a word-puzzle guessing game where players need to guess the randomly selected 5-letter word by the computer within 6 guesses.
</p>
<p>
The computer selects a random word from the stored word list that contains nearly 100 words related to I.T.
</p>
<p>
After each player guess, the colors of the letters from the player's guess will change to show how close the player is to the hidden word. 
</p>
<p>
<b style="color:#6aaa64;">Green:</b> The letter is in the word and is in the right spot.
</p>
<p>
<b style="color:#c9b458">Yellow:</b> The letter is in the word but is <b>NOT</b> in the right spot.
</p>
<p>
<b style="color:#787c7e">Gray:</b> The letter is <b>NOT</b>in the word.
</p>
<p>
Also, the game includes a hint that is available after the third guess to make it easier for the player to guess the selected game.
